# Experiment 11
## Theory
A class in C++ serves as a blueprint for creating objects by combining data (attributes) and functions (methods) into a single unit. It supports object-oriented principles like encapsulation and abstraction. Methods within a class operate on its data members and can access both public and private members. Public members are accessible outside the class, while private members are restricted to within the class, protecting sensitive information and ensuring encapsulation.
